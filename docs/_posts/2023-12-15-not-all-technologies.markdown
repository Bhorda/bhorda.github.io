> *TL;DR Users imply problems, but not all aspects of the human experience are problems. Mental health, social support, and creativity are but a few aspects of experience that don't work in the lenses of user-centred design because they're not problems in the traditional sense. Its a deeply frowned upon perspective in therapy and healthcare to consider one to be 'broken' and therefore 'fixable' - I believe this perspective should extend into design. Human-centred design works under and around the **person** to support their life and circumstances.*

I've upheld this perspective on my career that I will be 'oscillating between academia and industry' and never fully committed to one or the other. To this day, I maintain that the chasm between the two is best described as a broken relationship that was once a happy marriage - now turned spiteful and cold. Startups and investors have pulled away from the slow and rigorous process of academia in favour of 'build fast break faster' ideals of product development. On the other hand, the responsible and merit-based (arguable) environment of academia produces artefacts that are professionally validated - a particularly important badge to gain when working in critical and sensitive fields, such as wellfare. 

My stance of 'I see good on both sides' is not novel, but after years and years of rehashing my argument I believe I found the root of my position in human-centred design. 

## Unpacking Human-Centred Design

Human-centred design is not always used appropriately, but it is a well-established school of design. Its more common cousin (child, actually) is user-centred design. The difference is not always relevant or respected, but ChatGPT does a decent job highlighting the contrast: 

User-Centered Design (UCD):
- UCD is a subset of human-centered design.
- It primarily focuses on the users of a specific product or service.
- The emphasis is on understanding and meeting the needs, wants, and limitations of the end users of a product or system.
- UCD often involves direct user feedback and iterative design processes to improve usability and user experience.
- UCD is typically more narrow in its approach, dealing specifically with the interaction between users and products or systems.

Human-Centered Design (HCD):

- HCD has a broader scope than UCD.
- It not only considers the immediate users of a product or system but also takes into account the larger context in which a product or service will be used. This includes understanding the human, social, and cultural aspects.
- HCD aims to create solutions that address broader societal and environmental issues, not just user-specific problems.
- It involves a more holistic approach to design, considering the overall impact of a design solution on individuals, communities, and societies.
- HCD emphasizes empathy and the need to design for diverse groups of people, often involving multidisciplinary teams.

The main point is that **human-centred design considers the human aspects - beyond the well-defined user of user-centred design**.
