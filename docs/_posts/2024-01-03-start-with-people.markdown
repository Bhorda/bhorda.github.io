In design, a common 'mantra' is to start with the user. However in my experience, this principle is more a good practice we encourage others to use - but never quite do ourselves. Whilst I believe that what I say here applies to the broader software design world, I will discuss knowledge management tools like Notion, Obsidian, and Logseq as the disconnect is most apparent to me here. These tools, despite their sophistication, tend to serve more as digital storage rather than extensions of our cognitive processes. This realization led me to the concept of "false derivatives."

False derivatives emerge when we design tools that mimic human functions – like memory or organization – but actually operate on computer logic. The user interfaces of many modern software applications, for instance, are essentially front-ends for databases. They don’t mimic the fluid, imperfect, and sometimes chaotic nature of human memory and thought. As a result, these tools become less about enhancing human capability and more about adapting human behavior to machine efficiency.

This trend raises a fundamental question: Are we designing for people, or are we simply creating more intuitive ways to interact with computers? The essence of false derivatives lies here – as we iterate and evolve software, we drift away from the original human-centric goal.

My journey with knowledge management tools, swinging from digital applications back to pen and paper, reflects a longing for a system that works more like the human brain – not perfectly organized, but capable of adapting, forgetting, and re-discovering in an organic way. This led me to advocate for "imperfect design," a concept where tools are designed to mirror the fallibility and unpredictability of human thought.

The core message here is not to eschew technological advances but to realign them with our human nature. As we embark on new projects, we should discard preconceived notions of existing solutions and start afresh with the fundamental question: What are we trying to achieve for the human user? In doing so, we may find ourselves creating tools that are not just good software, but good design – resonating deeply with the way we naturally think, remember, and create.
