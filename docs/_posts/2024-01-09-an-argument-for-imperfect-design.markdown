"Imperfect design" typically refers to a design philosophy or approach that embraces flaws, irregularities, and the uniqueness that comes from human craftsmanship or natural processes. Instead of striving for machine-like precision and uniformity, imperfect design celebrates the beauty and character found in imperfections. This approach often features in handmade items, organic materials, and artisanal works, where the slight variations and 'imperfections' are seen as valuable and characterful, rather than as flaws to be corrected. This concept is closely related to ideas like "wabi-sabi" in Japanese aesthetics, which finds beauty in the impermanent, incomplete, and imperfect.
