What if we had like a plugin that looked at our entire personal website and linked it to other ones in a database - focus on it being for individuals and not companies or content houses. Find people working on similar things. A thinker database - a school directory.

People register their website, put the code on their website, their website is then scraped and analysed and indexed, and little chips and related people and articles are then included within the site based on that content.
