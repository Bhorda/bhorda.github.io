I used to travel the web regularly to find hidden gems - I imagine myself as a backpacker navigating from old brochures instead of through digital maps and websites that are there to draw me in. Over the past few months this habit had faded, until last week when I found a new personal blog that triggered the 'netpacker' in me. 

Some of the best ideas and thoughts I've found on the web were not found on big platforms, but rather people's personal websites. Maggie Appleton's digital garden, Linus "The Sephist" Lee's work on tools for thought, Frederick van Amstel's work on the 'user problem' are some of the most impactful writings in my work and career. 

Of course, I soon found out its not an original thought and there are plenty of 'maps of the internet'. I will maintain this page as my map of maps of the interne for now:
