title:  "Spatial software - trend or antitrend?"

*There is enough hype in spatial software to call it a trend by now. Especially with the Apple Vision Pro launch, anyone could be certain it will become more prevalent much sooner than later. However, what it represents today - in expression and creativity - seems more like the antitrend to linear / overly structured / inexpressive paradigm of long-form content we have today. An antitrend is an opposition to current trends, rather than a trend that stands on its own.*

I’m not convinced that spatial software is solving the problem of inadequacy in todays interfaces. I’m not even sure if it’s figured out the problem it’s addressing. I’ve never created a “knowledge graph” in my notebooks. I don’t think I’d use infinite paper much either - I get lost easily.

Yet there’s more and more software out there that claim it to be the next paradigm. Sane (see above), Kosmik, and Logseq (Roam before it went rogue) all speak of some hidden but unlockable creative and expressive energy in the spatial design paradigm. But I feel like it’s harder for even me to follow when it’s ‘spatial’, it’s like the creation is not quite done yet. 

Language is linear, we’re fighting its inherent nature asking it to change. I think we just need to learn to write better. When I read I wander, I branch off. Those branches are linear themselves. But they’re not a graph, there are no obvious steps. Like walking through a forest I end up somewhere. And honestly the forest itself has no story, only the destination and the decision to branch off. 

I feel like the problem is that linear storytelling is not satisfying - whether it’s because it’s too long or because it doesn’t let us explore. But if you consider best storytelling methods, they are methodical. I'd argue your favourite book has multiple threads in it, split into chapters; your favourite series is surely a tangled web of threads that appear or are tied up. Its not accidental that these structures engage us - the rhythm of stories gives us space to imagine and create our own hypothetical paths. 

I do get it though - the opposite of linear is perhaps spatial, or perhaps it’s the evolution from 1 dimensional to two dimensional. But I don’t believe the  problem is the dimensions. Take this image of my [post (🔌) on human-centred design](searle.hu/posts/2023-12-15-not-all-technologies) below:

Its boring, its not exciting to read, my eyes are being lead not invited. Watch what happens if I 'shuffle' it up a bit, create some breadth, some things to find. Notice the use of the margins as background to the content that is the foreground. I can put my person and expression there. This is not new - its where the comments go in most notes apps. *Like when writing on paper.*

This is a tiny example, and perhaps not perfect either - the stories *are always* linear, we just don't experience them that way. I'll leave with a final show of what I'm trying to get at. John Cage's 'lecture on nothing' is an excellent example of adding rhythm to text.

I think it’s less about having everything there and more about their relationship to each other. Like feng shui. It’s the space between the things that holds meaning and power. Foreground and background both exist not to overwhelm. That’s what exploration is about.
