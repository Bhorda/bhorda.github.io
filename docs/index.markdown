    <p>My research focuses on human-centred design and emotional ergonomics supported by intelligent systems. I prototype experimental interfaces that emphasise the human over the user.</p>

I'm currently working on speculative tools for knowledge representation, well-being support, and communication. My main projects are **Void**, an app challenging the note-taking trends by focusing on capture over recall; and **Amulet**, an app for social journalling through analogies and metaphors of energy to nurture support networks. 

I share my writings here that cover topics such as design research, case studies, and software development. I adapt some of these writings into videos on YouTube to promote accessibility and community for my research.

I'm currently designing products with startups at **No Blank Space**. Previously, I was a product manager at Techwolf. I studied human-computer interaction at University College London and computer science at the University of Cambridge.
