[**Soulbloom: towards physicalisation of personal data for well-being and communication**](https://searle.hu/assets/Soulbloom.pdf) - *2023*\
Soulbloom is a speculative tangible interface that promotes self-awareness and mental health by mirroring oneâ€™s physical and mental state through symbolic interactions. The project aims to imagine a future where AI and robotics can be perceived as empathetic extensions of oneself, furthering our understanding of human-technology relationships and how they are formed.
