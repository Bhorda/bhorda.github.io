# projects

I'm currently working on speculative tools for knowledge representation, well-being support, and communication. My main projects are <a href="www.noblank.space/work/amulet">Amulet</a>, an app for social journalling through analogies and metaphors of energy to nurture support networks, and <a href="www.searle.hu">StoryPath</a>, a platform for immersive mixed reality city-wide adventures and stories.

<a href="https://searle.hu/assets/Soulbloom.pdf">Soulbloom: towards physicalisation of personal data for well-being and communication</a> - *2023*\
Soulbloom is a speculative tangible interface that promotes self-awareness and mental health by mirroring one’s physical and mental state through symbolic interactions. The project aims to imagine a future where AI and robotics can be perceived as empathetic extensions of oneself, furthering our understanding of human-technology relationships and how they are formed.

As part of my Master's studies, I participated in a group project developing assistive technologies for people with motor neurone disease (MND). Through co-design with Brian, a person with MND, we designed a tool to enable emotionality in computer-assisted communication devices frequently used by people with speech issues. This blog post describes the project and is expected to be published on the department website.
