Amulet is a social journalling app that allows people to communicate and share their physical and mental state through metaphors and images. Unlike other journalling apps, Amulet promotes the social expression of well-being as a complement to personal journalling. Social support networks have been shown to address issues with isolation and communication, as well as foster self-management skills within the user through collective responsibility and reliance.

The target audience eventually reach a greater community, but today the project concentrates on the following groups: 
- People with disabilities that compromise their social and mental well-being due to isolation and agency,
- People with mental health issues,
- Members of support groups, 
- Professional therapists and their patients. 

The project employs the theoretical and practical results of my personal energy management research, which is based in activity theory, ludic design, human-centred design, and self-tracking practices. I am currently a Research Assistant at UCL working on publishing and continuing this work. 

*Amulet is expected to be released for alpha testing in Summer 2024.*
