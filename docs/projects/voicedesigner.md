# “Can you tell I’m being sarcastic?” Designing for emotional prosody in AAC devices

> _**Disclaimer: This blog describes a group project from my Master's studies on Disability Interaction. I worked with a group of 5 peers so this is NOT solely my own work.** If you wish to reach out to the rest of the team, please contact me and I will inquire about their availability. It is expected to be published soon in the department's Disability Interaction student handbook._

“Mike Not Dead”. These words were poignantly expressed by Mike, a construction worker from London with late stage Motor Neurone Disease (MND). MND is a rare condition that causes progressive deterioration of the motor nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and impairment in mobility, dexterity, and speech [1]. People with this condition experience their body gradually degrade while their mental function remains intact, with one’s need for social connection, shared reverie, and self-expression. This challenge is expressed in Mike’s words: MND creates a dissonance between the external and internal self. It is this challenge that our solution sought to address.

## Defining the challenges in communication

For people with MND, this challenge hinges on communication. Communication allows the internal self to exist in the physical, for one to share their experience with the world around them. Ed, a retired rugby player with early-stage MND, emphasised this value: “The most important thing is that I will still be able to communicate with people. Without that, there’s nothing of me left.” Assurance of the capacity for communication meant Ed felt prepared for the disease’s inevitable progression, as he would not lose connection to the social world that made him Ed. Similarly, Mike wrote and presented poetry to process his renegotiation of self and share it with the world. For both individuals, communication is inseparable from the preservation of self against a disease that tries to consume it.

We spoke to Emily, an MND-specific speech language pathologist, to understand communication challenges in MND. Emily affirmed that voice and communication are central to the preservation of identity as MND progresses. Voice banking has become a popular intervention, allowing patients to record and use their own voice for later automated communication [2]. However, expression is still robotic, lacking the contextual and emotional elements that are imbued in speech. Message banking is an attempted solution to this, where people record specific phrases, such as “no way!”, with tone and intention to manually replace automated speech [3]. However, message banking is arduous and lacking in professional support for implementation. Thus, there is an unmet need for AAC devices that allow emotional context to be conveyed in communication.

Emily introduced us to Brian, a father of five who was diagnosed with MND in 2020. An advocate for MND awareness, Brian has a YouTube channel where he posts videos about the progression of his disease and his experience over this process. The videos feature Brian looking at the camera while his AAC device delivers his pre-typed words. Brian’s eyes sparkled when telling a joke or dimmed when referencing a sadder part of his journey. As later confirmed by Brian, this was the only way for him to express his emotions when communicating.

Brian unpacked the value and challenges of communication during weekly visits from his children and a close friend. He longed for deep conversations in which he could confide his struggles and affirm his appreciation and pride for his loved ones. He wrote his children letters, offering fatherly wisdom, and read these to them when they visited. While the words themselves reflected his feelings, their automated delivery lost the emotionality of expression, meaning he felt a dissonance between himself and his speech in these intimate interactions. “That is the hardest part”, he stated with tears in his eyes, “I can’t fully express how I feel.” He affirmed that his greatest need was to integrate his emotional intention into his communication so that he could connect more deeply with his family and friends.

## Co-designing a solution: Emotional voice filters

Taking Brian’s core problem, we explored how we might integrate emotion into AAC-based expression for intimate synchronous communication. Through crazy-eights ideation, we defined two directions for a solution: how to input the user’s emotional state into the AAC device and how to augment output with this emotional information. We decided the latter was a significant gap with potential to address Brian’s needs directly. We further recognised that emotional expression is not the same for everyone. For example, where one person might aggressively raise their voice to convey anger, another may become detached and quiet. Thus, to add emotionality in a way that is naturalistic and user-appropriate, we proposed an AAC device add-on for users to create voice filters for specific emotions or contexts, such as feeling euphoric or having an intimate conversation with one’s children. Each filter is created by adjusting six voice parameters, based on musical theory, that comprise emotionality in speech [4]. By enabling customisation, users can create and add filters that align with how they express emotional states, allowing their internal self to be integrated into their communication with the outside world.

We hope that our solution may pave the direction for helping people with MND to connect with their social sphere through more natural and emotionally-reflective communication. Sharing our proposed solution and prototype with Emily and Brian, we received an enthusiastic response, noting the user-based customisability and versatility of the solution for adding emotion- and context-specific expressive elements as particularly valuable. While further usability testing amongst target users with a physical prototype is required, their response indicates that the solution can indeed address the communication needs of MND patients like Brian. 

There is a need to recognise that communication extends far beyond the verbalization of words when designing assistive technology. It is the manifestation of one’s sense of self in the external world, inseparable from one’s identity and emotional experience, allowing for social connection and the affirmation of self. While our solution is only a small step towards realising this, it repositions the emotional and social needs of people with MND at the forefront when designing AAC devices, ensuring that communication reflects the user and their needs.
