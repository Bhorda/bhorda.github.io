***"Using [AI] tools to make more of the artwork you want is valid, but you're not a creator, you're still a consumer." - Tris from No Boilerplate."***

This quote is from before the reupload of their [video on creating the **Brain-Made Mark**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kul0z3OTmVM). They now use the word 'curator' instead of 'consumer', but I feel that the distinction is still important. A curator's role assumes *context* when making their offering.

Thus, the purpose of this note is to collect a few resources that I have found to be inspiring.

- https://public.work
- https://archives.design
- [British Library Archive](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/albums/)
- [Internet Archive](https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/)

And for a *very* deep dive, here's a living collection of archives (that I will be curating from):

- [Casual Archivist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lyvVIqdGW78vftPu3rBUUqHfiFPltYntCLPUbkWxYew/edit?usp=sharing)

[Cosmos](https://www.cosmos.so/benjibo) calls itself the Pinterest for creatives - I use it like Zotero for design. Feel free to join me in curating more strictly Brain-Made work.
